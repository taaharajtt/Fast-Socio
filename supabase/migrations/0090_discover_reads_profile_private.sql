-- FAST SOCIO — F16 / VULN-04 step 2 of 3: repoint the matching engine
--
-- get_discover_candidates() reads the caller's own matching preferences from
-- profiles. 0091 drops those columns, so the `me` CTE moves to profile_private.
-- That is the ONLY change in this function -- every CTE, weight and ordering
-- below is byte-identical to the version captured from live on 2026-07-17.
--
-- Safe because this function is SECURITY DEFINER: it runs as the table owner
-- and bypasses profile_private's RLS, so it can still read preferences while
-- clients cannot read anyone's but their own.
--
-- LEFT JOIN, not JOIN: a profiles row without a private row must still get a
-- deck (it just scores without the preference bonuses) rather than vanishing.
-- 0089 backfills every existing user and triggers a row for every new one, so
-- this should never miss -- but a missing row degrades the score rather than
-- silently emptying someone's Discover tab.
--
-- Note `base` selects `p.*` from profiles. After 0091 that expands to fewer
-- columns, which is fine: the final SELECT names its columns explicitly and
-- none of them are private.
--
-- Not carried over: pref_genders and relationship_pref. This function never
-- read them -- it only uses pref_semester_min/max and pref_verified_only. They
-- are collected by onboarding and consumed by nothing, which is worth revisiting
-- (collecting the most sensitive field on the platform to feed no feature).
